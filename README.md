# Treat Fetch
This repository contains the contents of the first game I had ever programmed (early 2018).

## Programming Information
I developed this game using [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) and its Java implementation.

## Installation
>Note that you will need to download the .Zip file from this repository and rename the root folder from "Treat_Fetch-master" to "Treat_Fetch" in order for the references in the code to be accessed.

To play this game, you will need to download the Processing 3 development evnironment and import the Minim audio library. After doing so, you will be able to run the game by accessing the Treat_Fetch.pde.
## Gameplay
This game is played with the mouse only, as you are able to move a dog around a grass lawn to collect bones that are being thrown at them. If your dog misses 3 bones, the game is over, and you have the choice of:

* Picking another dog to play as
* Viewing recent scores
* Viewing all-time high score
* Trying again with the same settings

If you reach 50 bones without losing, you will unlock the "secret dog" who's image is blacked out and has "???" as their name. I made this addition to show my nephews the power of programming, by adding their dog into the game.
